Using Tensorflow 2.0 to recognise MNIST handwritten digits

A simple project used to get familiar with Tensorflow 2.0 and create a model that recognises handwritten digits based on the classic MNIST dataset

Running main.py gave the following results:
(Note, due to the inherent randomness in initialising weights etc, running this code yourself/repeatedly may give slightly different results)
